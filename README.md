# Hi, I’m @book-a-dev
I am a french web developper and a former bookseller. I develop web apps and websites, mainly for bookshops, bookstores or other cultural venues and events.

I’m still currently learning. But do not hesitate to contact me, ask for collaboration or collaborate on my own projects !
